<p><strong>Warning</strong>&emsp;Using an LLM in technical or safety-critical endeavors can be <strong>dangerously misleading.</strong>
    LLMs generate responses based on patterns in training data, not on real-time facts or rigorous analysis, 
    which means they can confidently produce incorrect, outdated, or incomplete information. <strong>Relying on such 
    outputs without expert validation</strong> could result in catastrophic errors, system failures, or even safety risks. 
    <strong>Always verify LLM-generated content with reliable sources</strong>, especially in areas where accuracy is 
    crucialâ€”lives, equipment, and important operations may depend on it.</p>
